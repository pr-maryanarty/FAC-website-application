                                this point in my life when goals and aspirations
                                shift. I really enjoy breaking down difficult
                                concepts and trying to tackle problems from
                                different angles.

                            around I focused on more general usage of JS, thanks

                            problems. However frustrating was it, I still

                        <p class="subtitle">Why coding?</p>
                        <p>
                            I’m a proponent of lifelong education, so within
                            these years, I was trying so many different things.
                            I am a former cheerleader, sport is my passion, now
                            though I’m more interested in yoga and pilates -
                            things that can also help our mind. I tried learning
                            illustrations, design and project management, but
                            <span class="text-highlighted"
                                >nothing quite hit me as coding</span
                            >. Coding is both: instant gratification, namely:
                            you see whether something worked out or not and at
                            the same time contemplation and deep concentration,
                            which takes a lot of brain power and drains you
                            completely, but isn’t that how we know we’ve
                            accomplished something? I strive for fulfillment and
                            self-accomplishment, I believe that coding might
                            help me do it. Web development is massive uncharted
                            territory where you still are able to achieve great
                            heights. I can’t say I’m particularly ambitious - to
                            me it, perhaps, holds a more negative connotation -
                            but I want to apply myself, I do believe I’m capable
                            of overcoming new challenges. Changing career in a
                            new country after you are 30 sounds like an
                            interesting challenge, I’m willing to rise to.
